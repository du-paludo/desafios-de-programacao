# Coding Challenges

This repository contains a selection of coding problems featured in competitive programming competitions. The challenges themes varies from week to week:
- **Week 1:** Introduction to C++ and the standard library, judges, and complexity.
- **Week 2:** Structures from the C++ standard library.
- **Week 3:** Complete search, permutations, and backtracking. Mathematical principles of sequences and inclusion and exclusion.
- **Week 4:** Greedy solutions.
- **Week 5:** Dynamic programming.
- **Week 6:** Binary search, divide and conquer, and Fenwick trees.
- **Week 7:** Number theory (factoring, sieves, and Euclid's algorithm).
- **Week 8:** Introduction to and search in graphs.
- **Week 9:** Shortest path in graphs, minimum spanning tree, and union-find.
- **Week 10:** Segment tree and lazy segment tree.
- **Week 11:** Topological sorting, connected and biconnected components.
- **Week 12:** Strings (KMP, hashing, trie, and suffix array).
- **Week 13:** Lowest common ancestor, heavy-light decomposition, and range minimum query.
- **Week 14:** 2D Geometry (representation of points, segments, and polygons, sweeps, convex hull).
- **Week 15:** Impartial combinatorial games, square root decomposition, and Mo's algorithm.
